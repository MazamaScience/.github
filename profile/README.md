# R Packages for Environmental Time Series

Over the last decade, Mazama Science created many packages focused on environmental
time series. These are used operationally in data processing, analysis and visualization systems at the
US Forest Service [AirFire Team](https://portal.airfire.org/home), in the EPA AirNow [Fire & Smoke map](https://fire.airnow.gov)
and elsewhere.

Jonathan Callahan currently maintains the following R packages:

- [beakr](https://github.com/MazamaScience/beakr) – A Minimalist Web Framework for R
- [MazamaRollUtils](https://github.com/MazamaScience/MazamaRollUtils) – Fast rolling functions for R written in C++
- [MazamaCoreUtils](https://github.com/MazamaScience/MazamaCoreUtils) – Utilities to help write production R code
- [MazamaSpatialUtils](https://github.com/MazamaScience/MazamaSpatialUtils) – Harmonized spatial datasets and spatial search functions
- [MazamaSpatialPlots](https://github.com/MazamaScience/MazamaSpatialPlots) – Thematic mapping for MazamaSpatialUtils
- [MazamaLocationUtils](https://github.com/MazamaScience/MazamaLocationUtils) – Utilities for working with monitoring site “known locations”
- [MazamaTimeSeries](https://github.com/MazamaScience/MazamaTimeSeries) – Core functionality for environmental time series data
- [AirMonitor](https://github.com/MazamaScience/AirMonitor) – Utilities for working with air quality monitoring data
- [AirMonitorPlots](https://github.com/MazamaScience/AirMonitorPlots) – Plotting functions for the AirMonitor package
- ~[AirSensor](https://github.com/MazamaScience/AirSensor) – Utilities for working with data from PurpleAir sensors~ (_deprecated_)
- [AirSensor2](https://github.com/MazamaScience/AirSensor2) – Utilities for working with data from low-cost air quality sensors
- [RAWSmet](https://github.com/MazamaScience/RAWSmet) -- Utilities for working with Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS) data

Each package has a dedicated Slack channel for announcements, support and to help build communities of 
practices around these shared tools. You may request an invitation to join from jonathan.callahan@dri.com.

# Mazama Science Past

Until December, 2021, Mazama Science was a small software company founded by Dr. Jonathan Callahan in 2007. 
Mazama Science provided modern, open source approaches to data management, analysis and visualization. The 
focus was on collaboration with clients across disciplines to make large, high-value datasets more usable 
with intuitive, interactive tools

During 14 years of work with national and international non-profit science agencies, Mazama Science offered 
internships to 26 young scientists, a dozen of whom spent between six months and two years working with Dr. 
Callahan before advancing to other opportunities.

_Requiescat in Pace_ Mazama Science.

# Mazama SciencePresent

"Mazama Science" is still relevant as a recognized _brand_, synonymous with high quality, analyst focused R 
packages as well as the creation of data pipelines and high visibility web sites in the field of air quality.

Dr. Callahan now holds a position as Associate Research Professor at the 
[Desert Research Institute](http://dri.edu/) and continues to 
create and maintain open source software libraries for air quality analysis.
If you would like to collaborate with Dr. Callahan, are looking for consultation on an air quality project or 
are interested in supporting the ongoing development of Mazama Science software packages, please contact 
jonathan.callahan@dri.edu.
